# Breast-Cancer-Project
###Implemented feature scaling, linear discriminant analysis, visualization, including visualization of linear discriminants.
Then, used Gaussian Naive Bayes and a 3-layer Feedforward Neural Network###
Classification of Breast Tumors.
I'm using a University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository dataset (Breast Cancer).
Basically, just copied this implementation https://github.com/dorian95/nn-from-scratch/blob/master/nn-from-scratch.ipynb
